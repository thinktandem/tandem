Good day fine Tandemite! It would appear you have an idea to improve our company. Bravo! Please fill out the following issue template so that we can get your idea fully fleshed out and ready for lift off!

## Feeling the Pain

Is this idea designed to assuage an existing pain or solve an existing problem you see at the company? Describe those pain points here. Have you already had discussions with your colleagues that they'd be happy with you sharing? The more people we can show as feeling the pain, the clearer the case is to act.

## Missing the Boat

Is this idea designed to take advantage of an opportunity that Tandem is currently missing out on? Describe the opportunity here.

## What is the Status Quo?

What are we currently doing to address this _category_ of issue? What strengths do the current methods have and where do they fall short? We should acknowledge our current efforts and explicitly decide if this idea would augment or replace them.

## Proposed Solution(s)

This is where the rubber meets the road. We've identified the problem, what are you thinking of for solutions? These don't have to be perfect, and its okay if they even sound a little crazy. Its also okay if you have more than one solution in mind that you'd like to evaluate. The point here is to start the ideas flowing so that we can diverge before working down to a solution we'd like to implement.

## Costs

Every change we make has a potential cost. Do your best to outline the costs you can see from this proposal from your current vantage point. While humans are terrible at estimating, there should be at least a good amount of thought put into this.

## Benefits

What value do you see this brining to the organization? Can you quantify, even in broad strokes what the potential upside is for Tandem as a whole? Does this have direct sales potential? Is the proposal about increasing effeciency? How many hours do you think we can save per week? How many projects do you think this could save a quarter? This is a *hard* question to accurately answer, and its okay if you aren't sure or your estimate is off, the point is to think about this and give your best estimate on what benefits we can expect. Here are some potential categories of benefits:

* Direct increase in sales
* Increase in project efficiency (that we might be able to use to increase profits)
* Increase in developer happiness (which descreases turn over - a huge cost to businesses like ours)


## Risks

What risks do you forsee in undertaking this proposal? Do you have any thoughts on how to mitigate them?
