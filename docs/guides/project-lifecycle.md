# Project Lifecycle

The project lifecycle at Tandem is an iterative cyclone aimed directly at delivering the maximum value to our clients in as little time as possible.

## Delivering Functional Software as Quickly as Possible

Providing value as early as possible allows us to:

*   Quickly adapt to changes in requirements, budget, or schedule.
*   Negotiate win-win deals with our clients that reward everyone for keeping scope small and quality high.
*   Experiment in a lower stress environment when client and internal needs are soundly taken care of.

Because we aim to deliver maximum value at the earliest possible time, our project lifecycle needs to have the following traits:

*   We start development of *working software* as soon as humanly possible so that clients can fully exercise ideas before significant resources have poured into them, allowing them to change their minds freely.
*   We involve clients in reviewing our work early and often. The shorter the feedback loop, the less time there is wasted going down the wrong path.
*   We require clients to actively participate in the planning of work to ensure that we are working on the most important features.

## Matchmaking

The process of delivering *working* software requires more than code. The definition of how the software works, it's constraints and limits is often much more difficult than construction of the underlying code. Because of this, the outcome of a software development project is dependent on the cooperation and team work of the entire **Project Team**, which includes the **Product Owner**.

To ensure the best possible outcomes for projects, Tandem needs to ensure that the relationship between the product/project owner and the development team is a productive one.

The first step in the project lifecycle is doing our due dilligence to ensure this to the best of our ability. Some high level qualifications:

*   Can Tandem use our standard development practices in this engagement?
*   Is there a single client contact who can regularly participate in the day in and day out project sprint cycle?
*   Is the client able and willing to participate in the project as a Product Owner (prioritize work, review work, provide feedback, and approve changes)?

## Sketching It All Out

Before we get into the nitty gritty of making things, we want to get a brief bird's eye view of what the client knows about their needs at the beginning of the enagagement. This should not be the Mona Lisa, this should be a really well thought out napkin sketch. All the pieces we know about should be there, but they can and **should** remain fuzzy. We want to get a sense of:

*   The client's *current* understanding of their requirements
*   The most significant needs of our engagement.
*   How much time we have to work (and by extension the budget).

Based on the above, if required by the engagement, we should create a project estimate for the client and associated statement of work, etc.

What we **don't** want to do is create detailed designs or requirements documentation. We don't want to skew the iterative process with shiny objects that aren't working usable software. We don't want to invest too much time into requirements that might change after our initial sprints.

## Getting inside the OODA Loop

In order to deliver working software quickly, we need to constantly work to shorten our [OODA Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop). The speed at which we can adapt to changing circumstances defines our effectiveness as consultants.

We begin concurrent design and development sprints, starting with the most important feature of the understood system. Inside the sprint, Developers, Designers, and the Client (acting as Product Owner) work together to deliver, review, and deploy work asynchronously with semi-regular synchronous checkins (determined by the team need).

This loop is repeated, going down the backlog until one of the following occurs:

*   The client realizes that enough development has happened that they are ready to conclude the project.
*   The backlog has been exhausted and has not be refilled.
*   There is a sufficient change to the client's budget or priorities that they need to end the engagement.
*   The budget or timeline is exhausted.

## Great Artists Ship

In the case of a coordinated launch effort, The project team sets a date, identifies launch requirements, and executes the required tasks and monitors the launch.

## Taking Care of Business

Support begins with capturing user and client feedback post-launch, and a new backlog of bug fixes and feature requests is created. At this point, We repeat something akin to the OODA loop for as long as the client has work to complete and budget to allocate.
