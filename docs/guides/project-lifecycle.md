# Project Lifecycle

The project lifecycle at Tandem is an iterative cyclone aimed directly at delivering the maximum value to our clients in as little time as possible.

## Providing value as early as possible allows us to:

* Quickly adapt to changes in requirements, budget, or schedule.
* Negotiate win-win deals with our clients that reward everyone for keeping scope small and quality high.
* Experiment in a lower stress environment when client and internal needs are soundly taken care of.

Because we aim to deliver maximum value at the earliest possible time, our project lifecycle needs to have the following traits:

1. We start development of *working software* as soon as humanly possible so that clients can fully exercise ideas before significant resources have poured into them, allowing them to change their minds freely.
2. We involve clients in reviewing our work early and often. The shorter the feedback loop, the less time there is wasted going down the wrong path.
3. We require clients to actively participate in the planning of work to ensure that we are working on the most important features.

## With all this in mind, the ideal project lifecycle looks something like this:

1. We qualify the client relationship to ensure that we can productively collaborate
2. We perform as detailed of a discovery process as we can with the resources available with the goal of:
    - Outlining the clients *current* understanding of their requirements
    - Identifying the most significant needs of our engagement.
    - Producing the most accurate estimate possible of the time and financial investment of the project both for the client and Tandem.
3. We begin concurrent design and development sprints, starting with the most important feature of the understood system. Developers, Designers, and the Client (acting as Product Owner) work together to deliver, review, and deploy work asynchronously with semi-regular synchronous checkins (determined by the team need).
4. Step 3 is repeated, going down the backlog until one of the following occurs:
    - The client realizes that enough development has happened that they are ready to conclude the project.
    - The backlog has been exhausted and has not be refilled.
    - There is a sufficient change to the client's budget or priorities that they need to end the engagement.
    - The budget or timeline is exhausted.
5. In the case of a coordinated launch effort, The project team sets a date, identifies launch requirements, and executes the required tasks and monitors the launch.
6. Support begins with capturing user and client feedback post-launch, and a new backlog of bug fixes and feature requests is created. At this point, step 3 repeats more or less as the client needs and has budget for in perpituity.
