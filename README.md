# Tandem

This repository contains assets to guide the why, what and how of Tandem as an agency-incubator. It may be useful to think of it as an "agency-incubator business" start state.

@TODO: improve above to be better, sexier, more feelsy?

## Why does it exist?

This repository exists to:

1. Express our mission, goals, values
2. Serve as a single source of truth
3. Define a process to self update itself and the mechanisms to do that

## Cool!, So, how is it structured?

This repository contains various assets but they can be broken down into four broad categories

### 1. Documentation

First and foremost this repo contains our manifesto, employee handbook and actionable guides to acccomplish specfic things. Let's dive into each part.

All documentation lives inside of the `docs` folder.

These docs are designed to:
1. get new employees up to speed on the tandem way
2. show prospects (new client or employees) what makes us tick
3. provide guides on how to do tandem-critical things

#### Manifesto

The manifesto should be our most immutable documentation. That is not to say that it should not be modified, but like the Constitution it should require signficant deliberation and consideration before a change should be made.

It should contain:

1. Why we exist and our core missions
2. Our core values
3. A roadmap for growth
4. An overview of how we got here (our history)
5. Roles and responsibilities for tandem in our three major contexts: company, agency projects, product development
6. how the above things connect together eg an org chart

what kinds of things go here?

#### Handbook

The handbook should be the place for all new employees to get spun up and integrated to the tandem way with minimal disruption.

It should contain

1. the things an employee needs to do on their first day to get rolling
2. company policy around benefits, pto, etc

#### Guides

guides should ultimately seek to answer questions like "how do i do X at tandem?". THey are designed to live our value of portability and redundancy. eg a person without a ton of experience should be able to read a guide and at least deliver the bare minimum value for a specific task.

we want to try and keep these guides as high level and company level as we can; there are many guides that might only be relevant to a particular deve use case or project class. lets try to keep those guides in our "templates/start states"

### 2. Templates

  SHOULD THIS live in docs/templates so we can have share it between the docs site
  and something we can pull?

  a. README.md and project documentation scaffolding
    a. readme
    b. getting started checklist: things that need ot be setup before we start
    b. dev docs
    c. project brief
    d. architectureal plan
    e. more?
  b. devops
    a. github issue/pr templates
    b. travis/platform/lando seeds
  c. project management stuff
    a. github labels?
    b.

### 3. Automation scripts

### 4. Lando plugins?

@TODO: anything else? this seems like a good starting point

## Awesome! But how do i use it?

1. documentation is surfaced here:
2. assets can be pulled down by our start states/projects should we just package up stuff into a zip for now and have projects pull that in?

## Great! But what if i want to contribute to it?

### proposing changes

what is the process for updating this material? how do we work on advancing the material?

considerations? PR template checklist?

1. maintainable?
2. have i written docs that already exist in our outside our org? example?

wef

1. everything stems from our values and goals
2. we propose initiatives and add them to the roadmap
3. we work on x-y number of initatives at the same time, we work on z-zz in a given year, each initiative should last 3 month
4. we dogfood our devops process for this repo
5. we make use of the issue templates to
