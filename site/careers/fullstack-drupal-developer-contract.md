Job Description
===============

We're looking for a **Full Stack Drupal Developer** to join our team as a **part-time contractor** and help us crush our upcoming web projects.

At Tandem, you'll work with a team of experts, including the maintainers of [Lando](https://lando.dev), multiple Drupal modules, Backdrop CMS, and contributors to a wide range of open source projects.

Essential Requirements
======================

This position is full-stack, but we prefer candidates that are weighted more towards the front-end. You'll need...

**Deep Drupal 8 Experience.** Have you been working with Drupal 8 for more than 2 years? What's your past experience with Drupal?

**Design to Bootstrap-powered Drupal Theme.** Translating visual designs from Sketch/Figma/Invision to fully functional Drupal components built using Bootstrap.

**Design Systems.** Creating design systems using composition and components rather than one-off pretty pages.

**Communication.** Ability to communicate with clients, designers, developers, and speak up when you see an issue.

Nice-to-haves
=============

We'd love to see examples of you working with...

1.  Vue.js or React

2.  Deep understanding of Webpack

3.  Familiarity with utility CSS frameworks (Tailwind / Bootstrap)

4.  Lando for local development (We maintain Lando, so knowing how to make it sing would be great).

5.  Laravel, or Symfony experience. You'll mostly be working on fancy stuff on the frontend, but always good if you can lend a hand in the backend)

6.  CI environments like Travis/CircleCI.

7.  Automated testing tools and services (behat, lighthouse, codeclimate)

Location Requirements
=====================

Tandem is a completely remote team. To apply you must be...

-   **Available for meeting 8AM-5PM PST.** Much of our team is in EST and we have a mandatory daily standup at 8AM PST.

Please do not apply if you do not fit these criteria.

About Tandem
============

Do you want a place to work on your own ideas AND make money?

Back in 2012, Tandem founders Alec and Mike had a crazy idea: using the profits from their consultancy, they could avoid the venture-funded rat race and fund development of new digital products themselves.

Since then they not only created [insanely popular products](https://docs.devwithlando.io) and helped [great organizations](https://thinktandem.io/work), but learned the power of relationships. Trust. Transparency. Treating people like adults. These are the values that created the Tandem team and sustain it today.

So if you have that wild, Muir-like spirit within you, the one that wants to climb the entrepreneurial tree and scream out to the world, Tandem is making a place for you. It's a place that feeds the creative beast while respecting your need for a balanced life. Because let's face it, we're all too old for this "ramen stage" shit.

Interview Process
=================

1.  Initial interview to review basic qualifications and for both of us to gut-check the fit. (15 minutes)

2.  Relevant code and devops tests (1 - 1.5hrs)

3.  Reference checks

4.  Followup interviews with the team. (30 min - 1hr)

5.  Profiting together!
