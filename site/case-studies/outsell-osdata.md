Outsell Inc. has maintained a large database businesses in the data, information and technology sectors for over twenty years. However, while the value of their insights had grown, Outsell’s ability to collect and maintain data was bottlenecked by a legacy data entry application.

Tandem proposed using Laravel to build a new data entry application. Laravel’s powerful object relational mapping (ORM) layer allowed us to quickly adapt to Outsell’s custom data model and create a front-end for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) actions the database. Laravel’s extensive ecosystem of libraries made it easy to find the best tools to power search, advanced reporting, and other features.

Now Outsell is able to onboard large teams of data entry specialists to increase its ability to collect and maintain records. By conservative estimates, this could lead to records being added and updated 10x more frequently than with the old system. Now Outsell’s customers can expect even more detailed reports and greater self-service access to company records.
